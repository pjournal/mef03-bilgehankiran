* After working on data platforms mainly focusing on business intelligence, data warehouse development and data engineering areas in several banks I have been working as data engineer at Hopi the Shopping App since 2017. I have had roles in the core areas of data technologies mostly, and now I desire to spend more efforts on learning how to harvest the data in order to get the best business values out of it. My expectation from this master’s program is to help me to enhance my capabilities in the areas of data analytics, predictive modeling & statistics, which I currently do not own significant experience.
